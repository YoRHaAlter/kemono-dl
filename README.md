### Notes
-   Default download location is a `Downloads` folder in the current working directory (will be created automatically)
-   Excepted link formats:
    -   `https://{site}.party/{service}/user/{user_id}`
    -   `https://{site}.party/{service}/user/{user_id}/post/{post_id}`
    -   kemono.party Discord links are not supported 
-   Gumroad posts are not compatible with any date options.
-   You must get your cookie file while logged in to use:
    -   `--kemono-favorite-users`
    -   `--kemono-favorite-posts`
    -   `--coomer-favorite-users`
    -   `--coomer-favorite-posts`
-   You may need to install `ffmpeg` for `--yt-dlp` to work.
-   If you get an error with yt-dlp the post will still be archived when using `--archive`.
-   If you get an error with yt-dlp please report it to their [github](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
-   Kemono.party sometimes gives attachments filenames that are links (seems to only happen on patreon posts). This will remove the correct extension making it seem like an extensionless file. Hopefully they fix this or I will try to make a work around for it.

### 416 Warning
If you get a 416 this should be fine, it should only happen if the file hash on the server is wrong. If this happens please check that the file downloaded correctly, if so report that the hash in the file name is incorrect to the appropriate sites message board.

### Examples
```bash
# downloads all users and posts from "users.txt" to "C:\Users\User\Downloads" while skipping saved posts in "archive.txt"
python kemono-dl.py --cookies "coomer_cookies.txt" -o "C:\Users\User\Downloads" --archive "archive.txt" --from-file "users.txt"

# only downloads user posts that were published on 1/1/21
python kemono-dl.py --cookies "kemono_cookies.txt" --date 20210101 --links "https://kemono.party/{service}/user/{user_id}"

# goes through all favorite users from kemono.party and posts from coomer.party only downloading files smaller than 100MB
python kemono-dl.py --cookies "kemono_cookies.txt,coomer_cookies.txt" --kemono-favorite-users --coomer-favorite-posts --max-filesize 100MB
```

```
If you wish to change the folder path for now you will need to edit these two functions in `main.py`

-   _set_current_user()
-   _set_current_post()

For discord servers you need to edit these functions in `main.py`
-   _set_current_server()
-   _set_current_channel()
-   _set_current_message()

If you edit these functions and the program doesn't work correctly you will have to figure out the problem yourself. Do not file an issue in this case.
### Deprecated Options
```
-i, --ignore-errors
--skip-postfile
--force-indexing
--force-inline
--force-yt-dlp
--favorite-users
--favorite-posts
--skip-pfp-banner
```
## To do
-  [ ]   Allow file naming structure to be changed in command line
-  [ ]   Allow file path structure to be changed in command line
-  [ ]   Add Discord service (in progress)

## Keep in mind
-  Using this might get you IP banned from kemono.party or coomer.party.
